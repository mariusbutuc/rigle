# Rigle

> Knowing the deepest levels of any piece of software lets you master it.  It’s a special kind of competence you can’t fake.  You have to know it so well you could build it.  What if you did build it?  Wouldn’t that be worth it?

This repo with follow along building a Rails-like framework from an empty directory, using the same Ruby features and structures that make Rails so interesting.

It's just me going through the moves of with @noahgibbs' [Rebuilding Rails](https://rebuilding-rails.com/).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rigle'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rigle

## Usage

Usage instructions here will eventually find their home here.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
